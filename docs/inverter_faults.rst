Faults
######

There is a total of four OIDs that make up a 128 bit wide field, with each bit representing a particular fault. Each of
the OIDs contains 32 bits. If no bits are set (i.e. the four OIDs return 0), no fault is present.

================ ==============
``fault[0].flt`` Bits 0 to 31
``fault[1].flt`` Bits 32 to 63
``fault[2].flt`` Bits 64 to 95
``fault[3].flt`` Bots 96 to 127
================ ==============

The table lists known faults, if the bit is set in the devices output then the fault is currently present:
